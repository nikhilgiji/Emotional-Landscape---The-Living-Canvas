# Emotional Landscape - The Living Canvas
The multi-sensory space resembling an abstract landscape. It's designed to dynamically respond to participants' emotional expressions, creating an interactive and evolving environment.The project leverages facial recognition algorithms and machine learning models to detect real-time emotions, driving visual transformations in response to participants' emotional states.

## Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Utilizes facial recognition algorithms and machine learning models to detect and analyze participants' emotions in real-time.
- **Dynamic Visual Transformations:** Drives dynamic changes in visual elements within the installation based on the detected emotional states, creating an evolving emotional landscape.
- **Multi-Sensory Integration:** Incorporates spatial sound design, responsive visuals, and ambient lighting to provide participants with a multi-sensory experience.
- **Ethical Data Handling:** Implements ethical considerations by prioritizing user consent and privacy in the collection and processing of biometric data.
